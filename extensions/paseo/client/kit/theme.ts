// The host's look, copied: the plugin SDK (0.9.1) exports only colours (PluginTheme). What is shown is
// piggery top's (ps --view); its finish is Paseo's (Settings → Providers: small muted labels, rows split
// by dividers in the border colour). Sources, in Paseo packages/app/src, read 2026-09-28:
