// dsh's turn events as the standard adapter events (pi's Turns, extensions/pi/adapter.mjs).
// Pure: no dsh, no socket.
//
// A dsh turn is turn/start ... turn/end (session events); a step (one model call and its tools)
// is step/start ... step/end. pi's awaited "before settle" is dsh's agent/turn-stopping: it runs
// only when the turn ends by itself, and mail steered in there makes the same turn run another
// step, so the turn is acked there (outcome ok) exactly as pi's before_settle acks it.
// turn/end then settles the run; how the turn ended decides the rest:
//   error                          failed (the turn_end the daemon gets, no ack)
//   aborted, blocked, interrupted  the run settles with no end of its own: Turns ends the turn
//                                  interrupted (no ack, no wake), so its mail comes again.
