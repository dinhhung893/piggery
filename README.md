# piggery-winport 🐖 - Lợn cày tasks

Your coding agents are pigs. Piggery is the farm.

Work goes into a pig's trough and waits there until the pig is back. It only counts as eaten
when the job is actually done, not when the pig sniffed at it. Every pig also has a pen: its
role says who it may talk to and whether it may have piglets (workers). The farm checks the
fence itself, so no amount of sweet talk gets a pig through it.

pi, Claude Code, Codex, omp and dsh pigs all live on the same farm and talk to each other. The
farm is one Go binary and a SQLite file, and nothing runs in the cloud.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a["agent on pi"] <-->|mail| farm
  b["agent on Claude Code"] <-->|mail| farm
  c["agent on …"] <-->|mail| farm
  farm(("🐖 piggery<br/>mailbox + gate")) --- shape[["a team layout<br/>supervisor → workers<br/>peer ↔ peer<br/>…"]]
  shape --> work[/"your tasks and projects,<br/>plowed"/]
```

Every agent gets the same mailbox, whatever its harness: a pi session can mail a Claude Code
session, and a worker's answer wakes whoever is waiting for it. Each mail and each spawn passes
the gate, which checks it against the team's layout: a small YAML file you pick or write. A few
come built in as examples (`supervisor-executor`, `slp`, `council`, `p2p`); any other shape is
another file.

## Harnesses

| Harness | Your sessions | Workers piggery starts | Tested with | Add piggery |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) | yes (extension) | yes (`pi --mode rpc`) | 0.87.1 | `piggery setup pi` |
| [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) | yes (plugin + MCP) | yes (`claude -p`) | 2.1.283 | `piggery setup claude` |
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | yes (hooks + MCP) | yes (`codex app-server`) | 0.157.1 | `piggery setup codex` |
| [omp](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) | yes (extension) | yes (`omp --mode rpc`) | 18.4.2 | `piggery setup omp` |
| [dsh](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) | yes (`dsh web`, plugin) | yes (`dsh --profile sdk`) | 0.2.0-rc.1 | `piggery setup dsh` |

A role's workers run on the harness its template names (`spawn.harness`), else on the one of the
session that founded the team. `piggery setup` alone shows each harness's version and whether
piggery is installed in it.

## Install

> **Windows build** — this fork publishes `piggery-windows-amd64.exe` for every upstream release.

Download the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/dinhhung893/piggery/releases/latest),
verify it against the bundled `.sha256` file, and put it on your PATH (e.g. `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`).

To update later, download the newer release and swap the binary, or run the update script from
your local winport pipeline if you have one.

The upstream install script (`curl … install.sh`) does **not** serve Windows builds — upstream
releases cover Linux and macOS only. See the upstream
[README](https://github.com/sting8k/piggery#install) for those platforms.

Using [Paseo](https://paseo.sh)? `piggery setup paseo` adds a Piggery view (the same as
`piggery top`) to the app. Turn on plugins in Paseo's settings once.

`piggery update` checks the upstream releases and will report "no build for windows/amd64" —
that is expected on this fork; use the Releases page instead. What changed is in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick start

1. Open pi, Claude Code, Codex, omp or `dsh web` in your project.
2. Ask it for a team: *"make a supervisor-executor team to fix the failing tests"*.
3. Watch the farm: `piggery top`.

More: [docs/guide.md](docs/guide.md) covers running teams, watching and stepping in, and customizing
`~/.piggery` (config, templates, worker profiles, your own rules); [docs/reference.md](docs/reference.md)
lists every command, config key, profile key and manifest key.

## Farm layouts

| Template | Who does what |
| --- | --- |
| `supervisor-executor` | A supervisor splits the goal into checkable tasks; executors do them. |
| `slp` | You steer a supervisor; each lane has a lead and peers, often in its own git worktree. |
| `council` | A chair asks members for independent views on one hard decision. |
| `p2p` | Peers that talk freely and spawn more peers. |

Make your own: `piggery template new mine --from slp`, then edit
`~/.piggery/templates/mine/manifest.yaml` (see the [guide](docs/guide.md#customize-piggery-piggery)).
